# CASPER

[![Launch on Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/j7sz/pollo---the-casper-saver/main?labpath=casper_official.ipynb)

CASPER, is a framework that enables websites to detect unauthorized login attempts using stolen passkeys. The name is a short for Capturing pASskey comPromise by attackER. This repository contains 1) the code of the prototype implementation we used for the performance analysis of CASPER. 2) the model checking scripts (in [PRISM](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/) model checking language) to evaluate the detection effectiveness of CASPER.

The paper is to appear at USENIX Security 2025. For details please refer to [our paper](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mazharul/files/casperUsenix25Islam.pdf).

## Background

FIDO synced passkeys address account recovery challenges by enabling users to back up their FIDO2 private signing keys to the cloud storage of passkey management services (PMS). However, it introduces an additional risk — attackers can steal users' passkeys through breaches of PMS's cloud storage. Unfortunately, existing defenses cannot eliminate this risk without reintroducing account recovery challenges or disrupting users daily account login routines.

## Results

We present CASPER, the first passkey breach detection framework that enables web service providers to detect the abuse of passkeys leaked from PMS for unauthorized login attempts. Our analysis shows that CASPER provides compelling detection effectiveness, even against knowledgeable attackers who strategically optimize their attacks to evade CASPER's detection. We also show how CASPER can be seamlessly integrated into the existing passkey backup, synchronization, and authentication processes, with only minimal impact on user experience, negligible performance overhead, and minimum deployment and storage complexity for the participating parties.

## Interactive Notebook

`casper_official.ipynb` is a self-contained Python walkthrough of the CASPER implementation and detection-effectiveness simulations. Click the Binder badge above to run it in your browser with no local setup required.

## Requirements

*   Go v1.23.1
*   Python 3.8

## How to run?

### Prototype implementation

*   The folder `prototype` contains the the proof-of-concept implementation of CASPER in Go.
*   The folder `detection-effectiveness` contains the scripts of our detection effectiveness run using PRISM model checking tool.

To run the prototype implementation type the following commands

```
cd  prototype
go test -v -run TestCasperLogin
```

Similarly to test CASPER's detection capability use the command `go test -v -run TestCasperDetection`.

### Detection effectiveness

To run the detection effectiveness experiments, please first download and install PRISM 4.8 according to the instructions provided [here](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/InstallingPRISM/Instructions), and then execute the following commands

```
cd  detection-effectiveness
prism <name of the model file .prism\> <corresponding property specification file .props\> -const <parameters\>
```

For example to run the minimum expected true detection probabilities (TDP) as a function of $\alpha$ with varying $m$, $n$, given a fixed $k$ (shown in Figures 6 and 7 in the paper), run

```
cd  detection-effectiveness
prism passkey_tdp.prism passkey_tdp.props -const unmarked_fraction=0:0.1:1,snapshots=1,sites=1:2:9,K=32
```

Here, the variables `unmarked_fraction`, `sites`, `snapshots`, and `K` in the code represent $\alpha$, $m$, $n$, and $k$, respectively. `unmarked_fraction=0:0.1:1` means the values of $0$, $0.1$, ..., $0.9$, and $0.1$ are used for `unmarked_fraction` (i.e., $\alpha$ in the paper). This command produces the results shown in Figure 6(b) in the paper, where $n$ = `snapshots` = 1.

Similarly, for the `eff` experiments (Figure 8 in the paper) with $\sigma=1$ and $\sigma=2$, use the `passkey_eff_std1.prism` and `passkey_eff_std2.prism` model files respectively. As an example, the following command produces the results shown in Figure 8(a) in the paper:

```
cd  detection-effectiveness
prism passkey_eff_std2.prism passkey_eff.props -const unmarked_fraction=0:0.1:1,lambda=0.5,sites=1:2:9,K=32
```

## Notes

*   This repository is a proof-of-concept prototype. Please review it carefully before using it for any purposes.

*   The current prototype does not run the RP and PMS on dedicated nodes to measure the network latency. In the next version we will provide the necessary scripts to do this.

*   We will also provide a docker image for reproducibility purposes.

## Acknowledgments

The virtual authenticator and client are implemented over the [virtualwebauthn](https://github.com/descope/virtualwebauthn) library. The relying party is simulated over the [webauthn server](https://github.com/fxamacker/webauthn) library.
